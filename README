This script is mainly used to redirect users to a RTSP server. Most browsers
does not understand the rtsp://, and by using this script you can get the

reference-file, and use the rtsp://-URL supplied in it.

See the bottom of 'makestream.php' for example usage.

An example .htaccess-file for Apache is also supplied
